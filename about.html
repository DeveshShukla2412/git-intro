        Underground Authority was formed in early 2010, when two of the previously existing acts from Kolkata, collaborated to put forth a new act together.
        They primarily started off performing in the premier pubs of Kolkata and participated in major music events, including the Closed Mic / Best of open
        mic at Someplace Else and Tuborg Unseen Underground Pub Rock festival.They were also the runners up at a national rock band competition, Yamaha Asian
        Beat 2010, held at Hard Rock Cafe in Mumbai.
        If not rivalry, then we would surely prefer the term 'fierce competitors' to describe us in the past, when we used to face off and compete as a band at
        the national / local music circuit. But then again, we always had this dream of coming together as a unit at some point of time and fortunately, it happened
        on the pleasant evening of April 3, 2010. We figured that all five of us wanted to experiment and come up with something new and unique; so when the idea of
        Underground Authority came up, we straight away went for it as we all had a gut feeling that it would result in something fresh and inviting.

        On 17 May 2010 – They had performed at a concert in Kolkata organised by Power 107.8 FM to help promote mass awareness on the extinction on tigers in the country.
        On 16 July 2010 – They had also been a part of a special night organised by popular city bands and individuals to offer a tribute to the Indian film music directors at the pub,
        'Basement' at 'Samilton Hotel' in Kolkata. They performed A.R.Rahman directed songs, 'Rukmini' and 'Humma Humma' in their own versions as a tribute to the former.

        This one’s a mix of alt, rap rock and reggae with politically charged lyrics. The essence of rebellion and against in their music is much appreciated by the intellect
        seeking Calcutta audience but the Hornbill winners have proved its mainstream potential with their stint at India’s Got Talent as well.
